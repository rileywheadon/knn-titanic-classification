This project introduced me to a whole bunch of new techniques. I was able to try a number of classification algorithms including
RandomForest, XGBoost, and SVM. I also learned how to create dummy variables and do some basic feature engineering.

My classifier ended up with an accuracy of 78.47%, which places me in the top 20% on Kaggle. I think I would need to do more feature
engineering to improve this further, but I don't think that's worth my time. Overall, I feel like this is pretty good showing for my
first Kaggle competition.
